# Smart Miata


## What is this?
This is a project to make your Miata as modern as any new car.

This repo contains all the code I can make open source. And I'm also writing a guide own how to use it and make your own Miata modern.

If you want a preview of the guide you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dYf8zrVUHt).

## Info
The Unity scripts are not a full unity project, there are only the scripts that I wrote and thus can make open source (see [this](#why-isnt-all-the-code-open-source), to know why I can't make everything open source).

## FAQ
### Can I buy a full product somewhere?
If you want a full product instead of making everything by yourself, you can fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/YhTYt9FMBn5yQ3Tn8) and if enough people are interested I might make a full product.

### Why isn't all the code open source?
I can't make all the code of the Unity application open source because I have used some licensed assets/tools in there, but if you have some experience with Unity you should be able to do things like the GUI by yourself. And all the harder stuff I explained in this guide.

What I can give you however is the build of the application. So if you don't want to program everything by yourself, but you also don't want a full product that locks you in on what sensors to use I could make the software so that you can customize everything in the GUI.

For example, you have an Arduino that sends `to` when the truck opens then you could open some kind of edit mode in my application click on the trunk in the 3D preview, select an Arduino port and select `to` as trigger for animating the trunk.
